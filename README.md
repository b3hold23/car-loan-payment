# Car Loan Payment Calculator

## Description

This project helps potential car buyers determine their monthly car loan payments at 0% interest, providing an objective starting point to compare with a third-party quote. By understanding the base payment, users can identify additional costs (i.e. market-adjustment, loan charges, add-ons, dealer fees, service charges, registration fees, and sales tax) in order to understand the true cost of purchasing a vehicle, and increasing the liklihood that the user will make an informed purchase decision.

## Features

- Calculate monthly car loan payments at 0% interest.
- Compare the calculated payment to a third-party quote.
- Discover potential monthly savings.
- Find suggestions for understanding additional costs.

## Usage

1. Load the webpage.
2. Enter the following details:

- Vehicle Price or MSRP ($)
- Down Payment ($)
- Loan Term (months)

3. Click the "Submit" button.
4. Enter a monthly-payment quote from a third-party (optional).
5. View the base calculation at 0% and the difference from the quote.
6. Click "Tips" button for suggestions to better understand potential charges.

### Example

If the user enters a vehicle price of $48,000, a down payment of $9,600, and a loan term of 72 months, a monthly base payment of $533.33 at 0% interest will be displayed. If a third-party quote was entered, the difference between the third party quote and the base monthly payment will be shown, indicating potential savings. Suggestions for additional costs are indicated.
